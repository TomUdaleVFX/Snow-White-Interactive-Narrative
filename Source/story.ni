"Snow White Interactive Narrative" by Tom Udale

When play begins:
say "Introduction.[line break]The story starts with a young woman named Snow White. She was the prettiest and fairest woman in the land.[line break]The Queen of the land had a magic mirror which allowed her to ask it questions and it had to answer truthfully. [line break]The Queen asked the mirror who the fairest and prettiest in all of the land was; the mirror replied with, 'a young woman named Snow White is the fairest of them all people say'.[line break]The Queen was jealous of this and wanted to be the fairest in all of the land so she ordered a huntsman to kill Snow White and to bring back her tongue and heart as proof, if he achieved this she would reward him handsomely.[line break]With his new orders the huntsman took Snow White into the forest with the intention of killing her."

The Forest is a room. "This is the forest Snow White is taken into by the Huntsman."
